        <p><b>Take 5</b> began life as Take 3, when Ali, Clarie and Kalana first put the eclectic mix of
        brass, wind, guitar and piano together in 2021. The group has now expanded to 5 with the addition of 
        Janelle on drums and Dennis on bass guitar andthis gives an added depth to their sound and versatility. Between them
        they perform on 8 different instruments and also vocalise, so there are endless possibilities and repertoire choices!
        <br><br>
        Take 5 are always in demand to perform, with members coming from The Swing Revue,
        National Symphony Orchestra of the UAE, Saadiyat Big Band and The Collective, most notably a performance at the 
        Australian Ambassador's Residence. Their jazz, easy listening, pop and classical styles appeal to a wide ranging audience
        whether playing background music for a brunch or dinner, or sitting centre stage.
        Take 5 always performs with passion, excitement and charisma.
        <br><br>
        Take 5 are very much looking forward to being part of "Jazz to Jive" at The Club.
