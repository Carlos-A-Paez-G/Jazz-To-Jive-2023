        <h1>A Message from the Producers</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Jazz to Jive, a unique, exciting evening, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else in Abu Dhabi.
			<br><br>
			We are delighted to present to you an energetic, toe-tapping, entertaining blend of a cappella, bid band music and dancing into the wee small hours.
			<br><br>
			At additional cost, feel free to partake of the foodcart, which will be serving [insert times XXXXX], and of course the bar, which will remain open for the entire evening.
			<br><br>
			If you wish to know more about the performers, the details of each of the groups and website/ social media handles are included within this digital program.
			<br><br>
